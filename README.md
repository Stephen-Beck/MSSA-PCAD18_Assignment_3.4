Create an abstract base class to represent “Beverage” and inherit “Coffee” class from it. Create a list ( you may use List class) of coffees. Design windows form application to display the list of coffees in grid and perform add/ delete.

Keep some base properties in Beverage class which can be inherited in Coffee. Inherited class can have more specific properties. Properties are customizable as needed.
